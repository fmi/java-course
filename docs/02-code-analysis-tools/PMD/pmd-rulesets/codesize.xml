  <rule ref="rulesets/java/codesize.xml/ExcessiveMethodLength"
    message="This method seems to be excessively long.  Very long
    methods indicate a lack of cohesion.  Perhaps you could factor out
    some of the code into helper methods."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/codesize.xml/ExcessiveParameterList"
    message="This method seems to have an excessive number of formal
    parameters. Could a collection of these parameters become a new
    object?  If so perhaps a new class should be created to
    encapsulate some of these parameters. Then pass an object of that
    type to this method instead."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/codesize.xml/ExcessiveClassLength"
    message="This class seems to be excessively long.  Very long
    classes indicate a lack of cohesion.  Perhaps this class is trying
    to represent more than one object. Could it be broken into several
    more cohesive classes?  Or could composition be used to simplify
    the code in this class?"/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/codesize.xml/TooManyFields"
    message="This class seems to have an excessive number of fields. A
    very large number of fields indicates a lack of cohesion.  Perhaps
    this class is trying to represent more than one object. Could it
    be broken into several more cohesive classes? Alternatively, might
    it be better to replace a collection of fields with an ArrayList
    or another collection class?">
