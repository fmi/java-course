  <description>
    The Naming Ruleset contains a collection of rules about names -
    too long, too short, and so forth.  This version of the ruleset
    includes alternate messages from the main PMD rulesets/java/naming.xml
    ruleset.

  <!-- ShortVariable -->

  <!-- rule ref="rulesets/java/naming.xml/LongVariable"
    message="The variable name ''{0}'' seems a little longer than
    necessary. It is important to use descriptive names, but
    excessively long variable names can increase typing errors. Try to
    find a slightly shorter (less than 17 characters) but still
    descriptive variable name."/ -->

  <!--  rule ref="rulesets/java/naming.xml/ShortMethodName"
    message="The name of this method is probably not very
    descriptive. Using descriptive method names (at least three
    characters) makes it easier for a reader to understand what the
    method is supposed to do."/ -->

  <!-- AbstractNaming -->

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/naming.xml/MethodWithSameNameAsEnclosingClass"
    message="This method has the same name as the class that contains
    it.  Did you intend this method to be a constructor? If so,
    remember constructors do not have a return type. If not, you
    should pick a new name for this method."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/naming.xml/SuspiciousHashcodeMethodName"
    message="This method looks like it is intended to override the
    hashCode() method, but it does not.  If you intend to override
    hashCode(), fix the method declaration.  Otherwise, change the
    name of this method so that it will not be confused with hashCode()."/>

  <!-- SuspiciousConstantFieldName -->

  <!-- SuspiciousEqualsMethodName -->

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/naming.xml/AvoidFieldNameMatchingTypeName"
    message="This field has the same name as the class that contains
    it. This is not illegal but it can be very confusing and is best
    avoided. You should pick a new name for this field."/>

  <!-- NoPackage -->

  <!-- PackageCase -->

  <!-- MisleadingVariableName -->

  <!-- BooleanGetMethodName -->
